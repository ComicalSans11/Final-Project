Group's repository: https://github.com/ComicalSans11/Final-Project



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
- Apparently you can begin a game with a title screen and end with one as well in Godot
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
- It's another shooter game, sort of a zombie shooter but instead of zombies the enemies are just implied sick people who have the coronavirus. 
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
- Definetely the title screen before and after, I thought that looked really good, really professional. 
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
- There are quite a few things about the actual meat of the game which could be improved upon. 
- The art was general and not particuarly special, as were the enimies and the control system. 
- This is a good example of what you can do with a game design engine, but not super fun to play. 
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
- They had a lot of scripts with an interesting format, but not terribly hard to understand. 
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
- I can't personally be certain that each group member played their part obviously. 
- I can say the game had some orinal art, and was heavy on the volume of the programming. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
- The license had one name attached to it, and as long as that works for covering the whole group, it was probably fine. 
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
- I think it's interesting they imply they intend to continue working on the game. 
- Maybe they should have included a way to get updates on that for those who were interested in following it. 
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
- I like the original intent behind the game stated in the read.me file, and I certainly have an affinity for the title screens, they make it feel more professional.
