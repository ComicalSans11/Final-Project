Group's repository: https://github.com/ComicalSans11/Final-Project



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I didn't know the control nodes included a menu node which groups the play and quit controls together. And at first when I was playing, I didn't kno how they made the splat of the bullet when the enemy shot it at the player until I looked at their scene and code. 
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
The COVID-19 symbol was used in the background of the game and once you "died" you were told you caught the Coronavirus.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I really like how random the enemies were. I think for future games I would include this. 
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I think they should apply code that doesn't allow the controlled player to move off the game screen. I also think they should write code to make the movements of the player smoother.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Nope, nothing was confusing to me!
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, it's clear that every member participated. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Some members names are unlisted in the LICENSE.
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I would add in how to actually control the player. And possibly the objective of the game. 
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
This game was awesome! I can't believe people can pull off creating a game like this, without meeting face to face, in 48 hours. The background and assets were also very smooth and pleasing!
