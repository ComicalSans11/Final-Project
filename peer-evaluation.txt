 A full game mechanic with menus and winning and losing screens.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 Maybe a directions option on the menu that tells players what keys do what.

 Nope

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Nothing really it's pretty descriptive and answers all the questions well.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
